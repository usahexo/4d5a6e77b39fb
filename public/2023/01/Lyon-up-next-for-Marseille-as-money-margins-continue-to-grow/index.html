        <h1 id="Lyon-up-next-for-Marseille-as-money-margins-continue-to-grow"><a href="#Lyon-up-next-for-Marseille-as-money-margins-continue-to-grow" class="headerlink" title="Lyon up next for Marseille as money margins continue to grow"></a>Lyon up next for Marseille as money margins continue to grow</h1><p>As Marseille gear up to take on Lyon in their next Ligue 1 clash, it is a chance for the home side to solidify their fifth-placed position and keep up with the league’s top three teams. It is also an opportunity for OM to continue raking in the profits, with ticket prices for this match reaching unparalleled levels.</p>
<p>With almost 37,000 tickets having been sold as of Monday morning, the average price of a seat at Parc OL has now surpassed €100. This surpasses the record set just a few weeks ago when Marseille played Monaco at the Stade Vélodrome, with tickets costing an average of €93.</p>
<p>Such high prices have inevitably drawn criticism from some quarters, with accusations that clubs are exploiting fans by charging such extortionate rates. However, Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud hit back at his naysayers on Sunday, insisting that “the market decides” and that “Lyon can do what they want”.</p>
<p>Eyraud’s comments were echoed by Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas, who responded to accusations that his club are ripping off supporters by saying: “I would remind you that we are playing at home and that we have invested €250 million (£221 million) in our stadium.”</p>
<p>Both clubs clearly feel that they have a justification for charging such high prices and it is hard to argue against their point of view. Marseille’s match against Lyon is not your average run-of-the-mill fixture - it is a clash between two of France’s biggest sides and one which is sure to be heavily attended.</p>
<p>With both teams vying for Champions League qualification, there is sure to be plenty of interest in the match and fans are likely to be willing to pay top dollar for a ticket. In this climate, it is no wonder that clubs are starting to charge ever increasing sums for admission - if people are willing to pay then why shouldn’t they?</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone can afford to shell out more than €100 for a ticket and there will always be those who feel exploited by the increasing cost of attending football matches. However, you can hardly blame clubs for cashing in on what is fast becoming a very lucrative industry.</p>
<p>The money margins involved in football continue to grow every year and it is inevitable that ticket prices will start reaching unprecedented levels. With clubs able to make so much money from TV deals and sponsorship agreements, it is no wonder that they are keen to maximise their income by charging as much as possible for tickets.</p>
<p> So far this season, average prices across Europe’s big five leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A &amp; Ligue 1) have reached an all-time high of £57 (€64), up 6% on last year’s figure. This trend looks likely to continue and we may well see ticket prices hitting £100 or even £150 in the not too distant future.</p>
<h1 id="OM-Profit-Margins-Continue-To-Grow-As-Club-Reaches-Champions-League"><a href="#OM-Profit-Margins-Continue-To-Grow-As-Club-Reaches-Champions-League" class="headerlink" title="OM Profit Margins Continue To Grow As Club Reaches Champions League"></a>OM Profit Margins Continue To Grow As Club Reaches Champions League</h1><p>The OM (Olympique de Marseille) football club has announced record profits for the 2017-2018 season, with revenues reaching nearly €440 million and profit margins up to 34%. This growth is due in part to the club’s success in reaching the Champions League for the first time since 2010.</p>
<p>Increased broadcasting revenue was a major contributor to the club’s overall financial growth. Broadcasting revenue from Champions League matches totalled over €70 million, with the semifinals and final alone generating over €40 million. Higher attendances at home games also helped to boost revenue, with ticket sales reaching nearly €27 million.</p>
<p>These record profits are welcome news for OM, who have been struggling financially in recent years. The club was recently taken over by American businessman Frank McCourt, who has pledged to invest heavily in order to return OM to its former glory.</p>
<p>McCourt has already made some significant changes, including hiring new management and appointing Rudi Garcia as head coach. Garcia is a highly respected manager with a successful track record, having previously led Roma and Lille to Champions League qualification.</p>
<p>The goal for McCourt and Garcia is clear: make OM competitive on the European stage and win back the French championship. With Champions League revenues now totalling over €90 million, there is certainly potential for further financial growth.</p>
<p>All indications are that McCourt is serious about making OM a powerhouse once again. The team’s current success provides a strong foundation upon which to build, and there is no doubt that fans of the club will be eagerly watching what happens next.</p>
<h1 id="Betting-Money-On-Olympique-De-Marseille-Expected-To-Bring-In-Significant-Returns"><a href="#Betting-Money-On-Olympique-De-Marseille-Expected-To-Bring-In-Significant-Returns" class="headerlink" title="Betting Money On Olympique De Marseille Expected To Bring In Significant Returns"></a>Betting Money On Olympique De Marseille Expected To Bring In Significant Returns</h1><p>The French club, Olympique De Marseille, has been a powerhouse in European football for many years. Recently, they have been on the rise, and are expected to do big things this season. Betting on them to win major tournaments is a great way to make some significant profits.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that Marseille is a good investment is because they always have a strong home record. This means that betting against them when they are playing at home is usually not a wise move. Additionally, they have a number of top players who can score goals and help lead the team to victory.</p>
<p>Some of these stars include Morgan Sanson, Dimitri Payet, and Luiz Gustavo. Combined with their talented manager Rudi Garcia, there is no doubt that Marseille will be a force to be reckoned with in Europe this year. So if you’re looking for an exciting team to bet your money on, Olympique De Marseille is definitely a good option.</p>
<h1 id="Marseille-Continues-Excellent-Form-Strong-Money-Flow-Seen-In-The-Coming-Weeks"><a href="#Marseille-Continues-Excellent-Form-Strong-Money-Flow-Seen-In-The-Coming-Weeks" class="headerlink" title="Marseille Continues Excellent Form; Strong Money Flow Seen In The Coming Weeks"></a>Marseille Continues Excellent Form; Strong Money Flow Seen In The Coming Weeks</h1><p>Marseille continue their excellent form with a resounding 2-0 victory against Strasbourg last weekend. The win makes it four consecutive wins in all competitions for Marseille, who are now up to fourth in the table and just two points behind league leaders Lyon.</p>
<p>This excellent form can be attributed, in part, to the injection of new blood into the side over the summer. £25 million signing Dimitri Payet has been particularly impressive, scoring two goals and providing two assists in his first five appearances.</p>
<p>The strong money flow seen in Marseille recently is indicative of investors’ confidence in their ability to continue this good run of form. In the coming weeks we can expect to see more investment flow into Marseille as they look to make a serious challenge for the title.</p>
<h1 id="Ahead-Of-Big-Match-Against-PSG-Marseille-Showing-Positive-Signs-In-The-Betting-Markets"><a href="#Ahead-Of-Big-Match-Against-PSG-Marseille-Showing-Positive-Signs-In-The-Betting-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Ahead Of Big Match Against PSG, Marseille Showing Positive Signs In The Betting Markets"></a>Ahead Of Big Match Against PSG, Marseille Showing Positive Signs In The Betting Markets</h1><p>It is not often that you will find a team like Marseille as rank outsiders for a big match. But when they take on Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 this weekend, that is exactly what the bookies are expecting.</p>
<p>The reason for this is clear - PSG have been absolutely dominant in France over the last few years. They have won the league title four times in a row, and they look well on their way to making it five in a row this season.</p>
<p>As a result, Marseille are currently priced at odds of 10&#x2F;1 to win the match, while PSG are at 1&#x2F;4. That makes them massive favourites to pick up all three points.</p>
<p>But as we have seen so often in football, things can change very quickly. Marseille have been showing some positive signs recently, and they could well cause an upset on Saturday.</p>
<p>For a start, they are unbeaten in their last four matches in all competitions. They drew with Monaco last time out in Ligue 1, and that was actually their first draw of the season. They had been losing games quite heavily before that run of four unbeaten matches.</p>
<p>Marseille’s recent form has seen them move up the table, and they are now in ninth place after picking up 16 points from their first 13 matches. That is still some way off the top five teams, but they are starting to make progress under new manager Rudi Garcia.</p>
<p>PSG meanwhile have been struggling a bit recently. They lost 2-1 to Strasbourg last time out in Ligue 1, which was only their second defeat of the season. Prior to that defeat they had been winning games quite comfortably, but they seem to be suffering from a Champions League hangover at the moment.</p>
<p>That loss against Strasbourg saw them fall six points behind league leaders Lille, who are now considered by many as serious contenders for the title this season. PSG can certainly afford to lose one or two more games and still win the league, but it would certainly give other teams hope if they did go on to suffer another setback or two between now and the end of the season.</p>
