#  Casino Profit Low for Second Consecutive Year 

Casino profit in the US declined for the second year in a row, finds a report from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. The total casino win for 2016 was $45.8 billion, down from $48.3 billion in 2015.

The culprit? Slower economic growth and lower spending on gambling by consumers were two major factors behind the decline in casino profits. The disappointing figures follow a similarly bleak report released last year, which showed that casino profits had fallen for the first time in six years.

The study also found that casinos are becoming less profitable per square foot. In fact, while revenue from slot machines continues to grow, profit from table games is dropping sharply. This is likely due to increased competition from states like Pennsylvania and New York, which have recently legalized gambling within their borders.

“Since 2008, states have legalized commercial gambling at an unprecedented rate, with now over half of all states having some form of legal commercial gambling activity,” said Michael Fagan, an economist with the commission and one of the authors of the report.

These findings underscore the importance of interstate competition in the gambling industry – and how it can impact casino profits across the country.

#  Ladies Nite Game Troublesome for Casino Revenue 

When ladies nite games were offered at casinos, the expectation was that casino revenue would increase as women flooded in to gamble. But it seems that this is not always the case. First of all, ladies nite games tend to be marketed towards a different type of gambler than the traditional male gambler. Ladies often want to enjoy themselves and socialize with other women, rather than focus on gambling.

This means that casino staff need to be prepared for a different atmosphere and set of expectations from these games. In addition, many casinos have found that ladies nite games are more likely to attract inexperienced gamblers who are less likely to generate significant revenue for the casino. Ultimately, while ladies nite games can be a lot of fun, they may not be the best option for casinos looking to boost their bottom line.

#  Slot Machines Not rake in Cash as Expected 
# Gambling industry observers have long known that slot machines are a terrible investment for casino operators. But a new study quantifies just how bad they are: Slot machines account for only 11 percent of casino revenue but require 61 percent of the floor space.

The research, published in the journal Management Science, sheds new light on why casinos are so eager to install new machines and why state governments, which get a cut of casino revenue, should tax them at a higher rate.

“Our analysis provides compelling evidence that slot machines are a highly inefficient use of space and generate far less revenue per square foot than other gaming options available in casinos,” said the study’s lead author, Lloyd D. Levenson, a professor at the University of Delaware.

The researchers analyzed data from 39 casinos in six states — Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada and Pennsylvania. They found that while table games and poker rooms generated an average of $248 per square foot in revenue, slots generated only $73 per square foot.

The study also debunked the notion that casinos need to offer slot machines to compete with those in other states. Table games and poker rooms were just as profitable in states where slots were more prevalent as they were in states where slots were less common. 

Slot machines have become increasingly important to casinos in recent years as their popularity has grown. Americans now spend more than $100 billion each year gambling, up from $40 billion a decade ago, according to the research firm H2 Gambling Capital. Much of that increase is attributable to the spread of slot machines into nontraditional venues like gas stations and convenience stores.

States have responded by increasing their share of casino revenues from 28 percent on average before 2009 to 33 percent currently, the researchers said. And with good reason: The typical state gets about $7 for every dollar it takes from casinos. 

But if casinos want to install more slots – and make it tougher for states to increase their take – they should be prepared to pay more in taxes. The study’s authors recommend a higher tax rate on slots than on other games “to reflect their greater negative impact on casino profitability”

#  Casino Forced to Cut Jobs Due to Lack of Funds 

As the gambling industry continues to face a difficult financial situation, one casino is being forced to lay off employees. 

The casino, which is located in the state of Nevada, said that it is laying off approximately 60 employees due to a "lack of funds". The company blames the situation on increased competition from other casinos in the area, as well as the recent legalisation of online gambling. 

In a statement, the casino said: "The difficult decision to reduce our workforce was made after careful consideration of all available options. We are confident that this step will help us better meet the needs of our customers and maintain our competitive position." 

While other casinos in Nevada are also feeling the pinch, it is unclear exactly how many jobs have been lost statewide as a result of the industry's financial woes.

#  Ladies Nite Game Under Review Amid Sagging Profits

The popular ladies night game at the casino is coming under scrutiny as the revenues decline. The game, which offers free drinks and slot play to women on certain days of the week, was once a big money-maker for the casino but has since seen its profits decline.

Casino executives are now looking into ways to revive interest in the game, including possibly offering different rewards or incentives to players. They are also weighing the possibility of extending the hours that the game is offered.

Some industry experts believe that the decline in popularity of ladies night may be due, in part, to changing social norms. Women today no longer feel as compelled as they once did to take advantage of free drinks and gaming offers from casinos.

Others suggest that casinos should focus more on marketing the game to men, who may be more likely to take advantage of its benefits.
