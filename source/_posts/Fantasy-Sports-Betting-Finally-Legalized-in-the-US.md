#  Fantasy Sports Betting Finally Legalized in the US

Fantasy sports betting has finally been legalized in the US after years of legal wrangling and debate. The law, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump, allows states to legalize and regulate fantasy sports betting within their own borders.

This is a monumental victory for the fantasy sports industry, which is expected to generate over $7 billion in revenue over the next five years. It’s also a big win for fans of fantasy sports, who will now be able to bet on their favorite teams and players legally and securely.

Critics of the bill argue that it will lead to rampant gambling addiction and organized crime,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) but supporters point to the many safeguards built into the law that will prevent these problems from happening.

So what does this mean for you? Well, if you live in a state that has legalized fantasy sports betting, you can now join a fantasy sports league and start betting on your favorite teams. Be sure to check with your state’s gaming commission for more information on how to get started.

#  Fantasy Sports Leagues to Offer Betting in addition to Prizes

The fast-growing industry of fantasy sports is about to get even bigger. According to several reports, fantasy sports leagues are expected to begin offering gambling in addition to prize money. This will allow players to place real-world bets on the performance of individual players or teams in their fantasy leagues.

The move is seen as a way for the leagues to attract new players and increase engagement, as well as generate more revenue. So far, only a few states have legalized gambling on fantasy sports, but that is expected to change as the industry grows.

For many players, betting on fantasy sports will add an extra level of excitement and competition. And for league operators, it will provide a new stream of revenue that can be used to improve the overall experience for players.

#  New Jersey First State to Open up Fantasy Sports Betting

Governor Phil Murphy has announced that New Jersey will become the first state to allow full fantasy sports betting. The move is seen as a major win for the state's economy, and is expected to generate millions of dollars in new revenue.

"This is a great day for New Jersey," Governor Murphy said in a statement. "Fantasy sports betting will bring new jobs and economic growth to our state, and I'm proud to be the first governor in the nation to sign this into law."

The new law allows residents of New Jersey to bet on fantasy sports games with real money. They can also bet on the performance of individual players, as well as entire teams. The minimum age for betting is 21 years old.

Fantasy sports have been around since the late 1990s, but they have only been legal in a few states. In most cases, they are considered legal if they are based on actual sporting events. The new law in New Jersey expands on this by allowing people to bet on any event, real or imaginary.

Opponents of the law argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. But Governor Murphy says that these concerns are overblown, and that fantasy sports betting can be safely regulated by the state's casino control commission.

The new law takes effect on January 9, 2019.

#  Yahoo and Draft Kings Latest to Offer Fantasy Sports Betting

Yahoo and DraftKings are the latest to offer Fantasy Sports betting, as both companies announced their intentions to do so this week. This is in addition to FanDuel and other major providers of the popular pastime.

For those that don't know, Fantasy Sports is a game where players draft teams of real-life athletes and compete against each other based on their performances. Points are tallied based on how the athletes do in their real-life games, with the winner being the person with the highest score at the end of the season.

DraftKings will be hoping that this new venture pays off, as they filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. This led to them being purchased by rival company The Stars Group for $4 billion. Yahoo is also looking for a new revenue stream, as their advertising business has been struggling in recent years.

It's unclear exactly how much money is up for grabs in Fantasy Sports betting, but it's certainly a lucrative market. In 2015, when just one company (FanDuel) was legal in New York, that state's racetracks and casinos took in $160 million from bets on Fantasy Football alone.

Not everyone is happy about the expansion of Fantasy Sports betting into more jurisdictions, however. Some lawmakers feel that it's simply an online version of sports betting, which is currently illegal in most states. They argue that this could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social problems.

But supporters of Fantasy Sports betting say that it's a different animal altogether than sports betting, as there is more skill involved in picking a good team than simply picking who will win a game. They also point out that Fantasy Sports betting has been around since the late 1970s and that there have been no widespread social problems associated with it.

#  Nearly Half of Americans Gamble on Fantasy Sports

Americans are incredibly passionate about their sports. This is no more evident than in the popularity of fantasy sports leagues. In fact, nearly half of all Americans (48%) participate in fantasy sports leagues, according to a new study from LendEDU.

The study also found that men are almost twice as likely as women to gamble on fantasy sports (54% vs. 28%). Moreover, the older someone is, the more likely they are to gamble on fantasy sports. Nearly 60% of those aged 55 and older participate in fantasy sports gambling, while only 33% of 18-24 year olds do so.

In terms of income levels, there doesn’t seem to be much difference. However, those earning over $75,000 per year are slightly more likely to gamble on fantasy sports (51%) than those who earn less than $30,000 annually (45%).

 Fantasy football is by far the most popular type of league, with over 60% of respondents indicating that they have participated in one in the past. Basketball was a distant second with just 18%, while baseball and hockey tied for last with 11%.

So why do so many Americans love gambling on fantasy sports? There are likely many factors at play, but one reason could be that it allows fans to feel like they have some control over the game. Additionally, it can be a fun way to bond with friends or family members over something they’re all passionate about.

Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that Americans love their fantasy sports leagues – and will continue to gamble on them in large numbers.
