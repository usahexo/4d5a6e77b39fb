In the game between the Houston Astros and the Oakland Athletics, it was the Astros who managed to take home the victory. The Astros had a total of six hits during the game, while they only allowed three from the Athletics. One of the most notable plays of the game happened in the bottom of the fifth inning when Alex Bregman hit a deep fly ball that resulted in him being able to score a run. This play was especially important because it gave the Astros some insurance runs as they were ahead by two at that point in time.

Houston got on the scoreboard first in this matchup after George Springer hit an RBI single in the second inning. Then, in the bottom of that same inning, Jose Altuve doubled to deep center field which allowed Marwin Gonzalez to score and make it a 2-0 game. In terms of starting pitching, Justin Verlander was dealing for Houston as he only allowed three hits and one walk over six innings pitched. He also struck out seven batters which helped him earn his sixth win of the season.

The Astros bullpen then came in and completed the shutout for Houston as Roberto Osuna, Ryan Pressly, and Hector Rondon each threw an inning without giving up a run. This was an important victory for Houston as they were able to retake first place in the American League West division. They are now one game ahead of the Oakland Athletics and two games ahead of Seattle Mariners. Up next for Houston is a three-game series against Minnesota Twins where they will look to continue their winning ways.
