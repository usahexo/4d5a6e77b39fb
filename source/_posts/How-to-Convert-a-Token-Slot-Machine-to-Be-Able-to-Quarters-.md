#  How to Convert a Token Slot Machine to Be Able to Quarters 

Slot machines are a great way to gamble and have some fun, but they typically take $1 bills. If you want to use quarters instead, then you need to know how to convert a token slot machine to be able to quarters.

The first thing you need to do is open up the machine and remove the currency tray. Inside of the currency tray, you will see a metal plate with a bunch of holes in it. This is the change insert.

Next, take your quarters and cut off their corners so that they will fit through the holes in the metal plate. Once you have done that, put the quarters into the change insert and close up the machine. Now, when you insert a dollar bill, it will automatically get converted into quarters.

#  How to Convert Your Aristoteles Slot Machine for Quarter Use 

Aristotle slot machines are one of the most popular types of slots machines available. While they are typically used for dollar denominations, they can also be converted for quarter use with a small amount of customization. 

The first step is to remove the door that hides the coin mechanism. This is accomplished by unscrewing the three screws on the front of the machine using a Phillips head screwdriver. Once the screws are removed, the door can be pulled off. 

Once the door is removed, you will see that there are two metal plates that need to be removed in order to get to the coin mechanism. The first plate is held in place by four screws. The second plate is held in place by two screws and it is difficult to remove, so you may want to leave it alone unless you are experienced with this type of work. 

Once both plates are removed, you will see the coin mechanism. The four screws that were holding the first plate in place need to be removed and then the mechanism can be lifted out. Now you can attach a quarter cup that is designed for Aristoteles machines. 

There are many different types of quarter cups available, so you will want to find one that fits your machine well. If there is not a cup available that fits your machine perfectly, then you can use epoxy or silicone sealant to secure it in place. Make sure that any sealant you use does not interfere with the coins being accepted by the machine. 

Once the cup is installed, reattach both metal plates and replace the door. Screw in the three screws and your Aristoteles machine is now ready for quarter use!

#  Turn your Token Slot Machine into a Quarters Only Machine! 

Are you tired of feeding your token slot machine every time you want to play? Sick of always having to keep a handful of quarters on hand? Well, there is a way to turn your token slot machine into a quarters only machine!

All you need is a screwdriver, some quarters, and a few minutes of your time. First, remove the cover of the machine. Once the cover is off, locate the coin Mechanism. On one side of the coin Mechanism you will see two screws. These screws are holding the silver dollar acceptor in place. Remove these screws and set them aside.

Now take your quarters and place them in the four corners of the silver dollar acceptor, as shown in the picture. Make sure that when you insert them, they are standing straight up and not laying flat against the bottom of the acceptor. Once they are in place, reattach the screws that you removed earlier. Replace the cover of the machine and you are ready to play!

Your token slot machine has now been converted into a quarters only machine!

#  Convert your Aristoteles Slot Machine for use with Quarters today!

The Aristoteles Slot Machine can be converted for Quarter use in just a few simple steps.

Begin by removing the door of the machine using a screwdriver. Next, remove the metal casing from around the reels. Remove the screws from the reel assembly and take it apart. You will find four metal tabs around the edge of each reel. With a pair of pliers, bend these tabs 180 degrees away from the reel so that they lay flat against the metal casing (see Figure 1).

Reinstall the reel assembly back into the machine and replace the screws. Snap the metal casing back into place and replace the door. Your Aristoteles Slot Machine is now ready to play with Quarters!
